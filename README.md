### Design Choices

#### Fonts

The primary font used is Maven Pro (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Maven+Pro) as it fit with the simplistic design choice of the website.

The secondary font is simply Sans-serif as it complemented the primary font well.

#### Colours

The design in itself is quite dark where the primary background color for all containers is a mix between #292b2c, #363940 & #000. In order to make text and other elements stand out I opted for a pure white #fff and primarily a bright yellow #FFCF74.

## Features

### Exisiting Features

#### Post Overview

The Post overview provides an infinite scrolling page of new posts in decending order where the latest posts appear on top. Here, visitors can click on a certain post
to see a more detailed view of the post.

#### Post Details

When a user clicks on a post this page will display the full post as well as the comments on the post. From here the user like the post and comment on the post.

#### Comment Section

The commments are shown beneath the post detail view. Here users can have a discussion relating to the post in question. 

### Future Goals

To create a better sense of community, future goals include creating topics that posts can be categorized into to seperate interests and discussions to the users chosen subjects. And to keep the discussion going, a notification system would help to alert users when a user interracts with their posts.
